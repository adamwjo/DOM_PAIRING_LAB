### Things to keep in mind

- Use the lecture code as a reference!
- The stylesheet is boostrap, so if you have trouble with changing style, look there.
- Experiment with selectors, and different ways to manipulate nodes!
- Figure out different ways to do the same thing / why you would use one method over another.
- Even if one person is "driving", you should still code along!
